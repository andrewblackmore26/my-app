      <p>Here you can find information about me and my work <br></br>
      Whether it be new projects or new experiences, these events will be uploaded/linked to here <br></br>
      Currently I am a student at UNSW, graduating in the year 2024 <br></br>
      I have a wide range of experiences, ranging from entrepreneur, content creator and traveller<br></br>
      And with the huge changes coming from tech in the near future, I plan to ride that wave<br></br>
      And share those experiences with you guys!<br></br>
